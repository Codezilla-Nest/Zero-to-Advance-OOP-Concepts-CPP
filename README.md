# Dynamic Arrays
>Dynamic memory allocation is the process of changing the size of the memory space during the run-time.
 ## Why we need it ?
 Suppose you have building an facebook like accounts creating application.Users can create or delete accounts.In your database all the accounts can be stored in an array of **Users**.Suppose 
 at morning the users of your application are **5** `{'Hamza','Abbas','Ali','Ayesha','Fatima','Mujeeb'}`.At evening a boy named ***Ali*** want to delete its account due to some reasons.When he deletes its account then at position of ali `index` becomes empty . like this `{'Hamza','Abbas','','Ayesha','Fatima','Mujeeb'}`.Till the size of array is **5**.Now **Ali** again wants to creates its ,so we wants to add it on `run-time` **How we can increase the size of arrays?ü§î**.
 Main problem is ,when we deletes the account the in our memory size of array is till **5** means our memory is wasting . And when we adding an account then how how we increase the size of array ?. To resolve such problems we need such a way to increase or decrease `dynamiclly` change the size of our arrays during `run-time`.It is not possible with the `static` arrays which size are always constant.Thats way,`DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION (DMA)` is introduced.

 ## Before Starting Something better to know (Heap or Stack):
  There are two types of memory in our computers ***Heap and Stack***.During Dynamic Memory Allocation, When we make a pointer of our variable its can be developed at the stack.(storing the address of our varible only) and its value can be stored at the heap.
  In `static memory`, all the varibles and arrays are formed in the memory (stack) at the `compile-time` so after exection all the variables and arrays are destroyed from the memory (stack) by the compiler itself. 
  But in `Dynamic memory`, all the varibles and arrays `values` are formed in the memory (heap) at the run-time, so compiler does'nt made them we `developers` made it during the execuation time. So its our responsibilty to destroyed them from the memory after the completition of their tasks.Otherwise a problem named `memory-leakage` can be created and our program `crashes`.
  >Making a dynamic memory is called allocating the memory. 
  >Deleting a dynamic memory is called dellocating the memory. 
 ## One Dimensional Dynamic Arrays 
  **Firstly**, `allocating`, we make a pointer of our array at the stack that containes the address of the first element of our array.

    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/ptr.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **Secondly**,we make a array at the heap by the `new` keyword.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/heap.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **Thirdly**,perform your tasks.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/tasks.png" style="height: 50vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **At last**, `dellocating`, delete the array values at the heap by the `delete` keyword.And 
  make the pointer of our array `nullptr` so its pointing to nothing.

 </p>

  
  ### How to change the size of our arrays at run-time ? or at execution time? How to increase or decrease the size of our arrays dynamically ? or at execution time? 
  **Firstly**, we made our array whose size we want to change dynamically.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/temp1.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **Secondly**, we create an temp dyanmic 1D-Array.Whose size is the size thats we want after changing meanns `size+increaseNum` or `size+decreaseNum` .
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/temp2.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **Thirdly**, copy the array to tempArray.
    <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/temp3.png" style="height: 50vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  **At Last**, delete the array values from heap and mutate the array-pointer to the tempArray-pointer.And now you can mutate the size as `size+=num` (for-increaing) or `size-=num`(for-decreaing) 
  >Both our array and tempArray pointers in the stack pointing to the same changed tempArray values in the heap.

    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/temp4.png" style="height: 60vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
    </p>

  **Now**,You can perform tasks, to the changed sized array ,after performing methods deallocate the aray and program happily finishesüòä.(Problem-Solved,Hurrayü•≥)

  * To Practice Questions Like ,insert,delete,shrink,add elements to the arrays dynamically 
  see [1D-Arrays-Examples](/Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Step0_Dynamic%20Arrays/One%20Dimensional%20(1D)%20%20Dynamic%20Arrays/)
  * To Read more complexities about the dyanmic arrays read book pages from
  [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/dynamic-memory-allocation-with-new-and-delete/)
  * To get slides of dynamic memory [Dynamic Memory Allocation](/Some%20extra%20concepts/Slides/dynamicMemory.pdf)

# Core Concepts
  A langugae which containes these four segments is referrred as ***Object-Oriented-Programming*** language.
 * ## Classes and object :
    Classes have no exixtence in the memeory,its only a blueprint.When we make an object of that class ,then it should having the some memeory.Class is an user defined-data-Type, called as ***ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPE***.
 * ## Data hiding and Encapsulation:
    Data is hided from every another object is data hiding .All the memebers of a class including data members and member functions are closed in a class like a capsule is referred to as Encapsulation.This feature opens the new term named as `Abstraction` means all the inner details are completetly ifnored and we focus on the working of the software.
 * ## Inheritance:
    ***Do not reinvent the wheel***.In programming the term used as : **Do not repeat the code‚õî**.Inheritance has the code reuse-ability.Some features are inherited from the base class and given to the derived class.If any language does not support the inheritance then its not calle the Object oriented programming language its called the ***Object-Based-Language**.
 * ## Polymorphism
  Define as : Single interface having multiple functionalities.(same name different behaviour).
  It has two types :
   * Static
      Function overloading is done in static polymorphism.It has be achieved on the compile time also called the ***compile_time_binding***. 
   * Dynamic
      Function overriding is done in the dynamic polymorphism.It has be achieved on the run time also called the ***Run_Time_binding***.


# Classes and Objects
  [What are classes  üëÄ ‚ùì](#classes-and-object)
  ## Basic Syntx of class:
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/class1.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>

  ## Basic Syntx of object:
  <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/obj.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">
 </p>
 
  we cannot access the dataMemebers of the class outside the class .Their members are by `default-private`.So when we want to access them .The error should come as 

  <p align="center">
    <img src="/Some%20extra%20concepts/codeSnaps/error1.png" style="height: 40vh; padding-left: 50vh;">

 >so when we want to access them outside the class,we use the `access-identifiers`.

 ## Access-Identifiers
  There are there Access specifiers.
* ###  Public
     Members declerad as private are only accessible within the class.
* ### Private
     Memebers of public are accessible from anywhere(accissble through the object).
* ### Protected
     Members are only accessible in child class.

 Result:

   ### Note:
   >The address of a class is same as the address of the first dataMemeber of the class
