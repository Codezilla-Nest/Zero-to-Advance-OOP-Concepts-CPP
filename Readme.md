# Table of Content üìÑ

If you're interested in seeing what I can do with OOP in C++, you've come to the right place! [My](https://github.com/muhib7353/Cpp-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-An-In-Depth-Look) Github repository is full of deep dive concepts that showcase my skills and experience with object oriented design. From simple demos to interview level concepts , I hope you'll find something here that inspires you.

A langugae which containes these four core segments is referrred as **_Object-Oriented-Programming_** language.

- ## Classes and object :
  Classes have no exixtence in the memeory, it's only a blueprint.When we make an object of that class, then it should having the same memeory.Class is a user defined-data-Type, called as **_ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPE_**.
- ## Data Hiding and Encapsulation:
  Data hided from every another object is called data hiding. All the members of a class including data members and member functions are closed in a class like a capsule is referred to as Encapsulation. This feature opens a new term named as `Abstraction` which means that all the inner details are completetly ignored and we focus only on the working of the software.
- ## Inheritance:
  **_Do not reinvent the wheel_**.In programming the term used as : **Do not repeat the code‚õî**.Inheritance has the code reuse-ability.Some features are inherited from the base class and given to the derived class.If any language does not support the inheritance then its not calle the Object oriented programming language its called the **\*Object-Based-Language**.
- ## Polymorphism
  Define as : Single interface having multiple functionalities.(same name different behaviour).
  It has two types :
  - Static
    Function overloading is done in static polymorphism.It has be achieved on the compile time also called the **_compile_time_binding_**.
  - Dynamic
    Function overriding is done in the dynamic polymorphism.It has be achieved on the run time also called the **_Run_Time_binding_**.

## Dynmaic Memory Allocation (DMA) üìï

Dynamic memory allocation in C++ allows for the allocation of memory at runtime, rather than at compile-time. This can be done using the "new" operator, which returns a pointer to the memory allocated. Memory allocated dynamically must be freed using the "delete" operator or a smart pointer to avoid memory leaks. C++ also provides "new[]" and "delete[]" for allocating and deallocating arrays dynamically.

## Classes and Encapsulation üì•

In C++, classes are used to define objects and their behavior. Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal details of a class from the outside world, and only exposing a public interface. This allows for data abstraction and helps to maintain the integrity of the data by preventing unauthorized access.

## Relationships among classes ü§ù

There are several relationships that can exist between classes in C++, including: Inheritance, Composition, Association, Aggregation and Dependency. These relationship can be represented by UML diagrams and can help to model the relationships and interactions between different classes in a program.

## Polymorphism üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

Polymorphism in C++ allows for objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This is achieved through the use of virtual functions and function overloading. It enables a single function or method to operate on multiple types of data, and allows for more dynamic and extensible code.

20. [Polymorphism](/01_Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B/15_Polymorphism/)

## Templates üßû

Templates in C++ allow for the creation of generic functions and classes that can work with any data type. This is done by using template parameters, which are replaced by concrete types at compile time. It enables the creation of reusable and efficient code, and allows for compile-time type checking. This feature is known as template metaprogramming.

21. [Templates](/01_Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B/16_Templates/)

## Exception Handling üî¥

Exception handling in C++ provides a way to handle runtime errors, such as divide by zero or accessing an out of bounds array element. It allows the program to continue execution instead of terminating abruptly. It is done by using try-catch blocks, and throw keyword is used to throw an exception when an error occurs. Exception handling makes the code more robust and maintainable, and separates the error handling code from the normal code.

22. [Exception handling](/01_Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B/17_Exception%20Handling/)

## File Handling üìÅ

File handling in C++ provides a way to read from and write to files on a disk. It uses a stream-based approach, where files are treated as streams of bytes. The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provides several classes such as ofstream, ifstream and fstream for reading, writing and manipulating files. These classes have methods to open, read, write and close the files and can handle both text and binary files.
