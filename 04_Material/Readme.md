# Boosted Material 1

- To Practice Questions Like ,insert,delete,shrink,add elements to the arrays dynamically
  see [1D-Arrays-Examples](</Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Step0_Dynamic%20Arrays/One%20Dimensional%20(1D)%20%20Dynamic%20Arrays/>)
- To Read more complexities about the dyanmic arrays read book pages from
  [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/dynamic-memory-allocation-with-new-and-delete/)
- To get slides of dynamic memory [Dynamic Memory Allocation](/Some%20extra%20concepts/Slides/dynamicMemory.pdf)

## Boosted Material:

- To Practice Questions Like increase and decrease rows or columns of the 2D-arrays dynamically
  see [1D-Arrays-Examples](</Object%20Oriented%20Programming/Step0_Dynamic%20Arrays/Two%20Dimensional%20(2D)%20%20Dynamic%20Arrays/>)
- To Read more complexities about the dyanmic arrays read book pages from

- To get slides of dynamic memory [Dynamic Memory Allocation](/Some%20extra%20concepts/Slides/dynamicMemory.pdf)

# Boosted Material 2
