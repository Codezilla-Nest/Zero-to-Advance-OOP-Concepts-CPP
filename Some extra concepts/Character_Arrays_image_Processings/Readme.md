/*The conclusion is that :
  character dataype is by deafult signed means negative is negative and positive is 
  converted into its value than its negative image 
  unsigned char datatypes are be always poistive

// Comparison between Signed Char and Unsigned Char:

 
//                         Signed Char                         Unsigned Char                       


//     Range

//                         -128 to +127                        0 to 255



//     Typical bit width

//                         1 byte                               1 byte



//     Example (x=10000010)

//                         Signed char x = -2                    Unsigned char = 82



//     Representation

//                         1 bit = signed bit
//                                                               8 bit = data bits
//                         7 bit = data bits



//     Declaration

//                         Signed char b                          Unsigned char a
