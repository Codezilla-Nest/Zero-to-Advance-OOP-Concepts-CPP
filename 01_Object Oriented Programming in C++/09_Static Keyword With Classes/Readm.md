# Static Keyword With Classes

### Defination

> Using the `static` keyword on a local variable changes its duration from **automatic** to **static**. This means the variable is now created at the start of the program and destroyed at the end of the program (just like a global variable). As a result, the static variable will retain its value even after it goes out of scope!

Static keyword has two uses with class which are discussed below:

- `static data member`
- `static function`
