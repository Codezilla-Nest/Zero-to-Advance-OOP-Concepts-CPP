# Static Keyword With Classes

### Defination

> Using the `static` keyword on a local variable changes its duration from **automatic** to **static**. This means the variable is now created at the start of the program and destroyed at the end of the program (just like a global variable). As a result, the static variable will retain its value even after it goes out of scope!

Static keyword has two uses with class which are discussed below:

- [`static data member`](/01_Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B/09_Static%20Keyword%20With%20Classes/01_Static%20%20Data%20Members/)
- [`static function`](/01_Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B/09_Static%20Keyword%20With%20Classes/02_Static%20Member%20Functions/)
