# Static and Dynamic Object Function Types:

Three type of functions can be implemented on the objects.

1. By passing object as a value
2. By passing object as a reference
3. By return object as a object

## 1.By passing object as a value

In `static` Pass objects into functions as an argument and use these parameters as a local object which has a complete access to the data members and member functions of the class same as for the argumentative object.

> The object which calls the functions is called the `Left_hand_side_object`.

We don't need to pass the two objects as the arguments beacuse L.H.S object is already exist ,and accessible to the class functions and we only need to pass the other funtions which is right hand side object.

In `Dyanmic` the copy of argumentative objects will not be made only the address of these objects will pass and dereferencing these adress and perform operations.

## 2.By passing object as a reference

In `static` When passing object as an argument to the function which recieveing it as a refernce parameter, then the copy of that object will not be produce.The address of this object will be use and its means any changing in data members or function members of the parameter object will aslo mutate the original argumentative object.
In `Dyanmic` the copy of argumentative objects will not be made only the address of these objects will pass ,so we will not have to use the refernce operator `&` , beacause already we pass the address `refernce` of the objects on the heap to function parameters As a result ,dereferencing these adresses and mutating the data memebers and member functions will mutate the original argumentative objects data members and member functions respectively.

## 3.By return object as a object

In `static` Return type of the function is a class name. When you manipulate some data and return a object made inside the function.
In `Dyanmic`,the returing object returns the only address of the making object not the object on the heap. beacuse when the function executes the making pointer will automatically goes out from the execuation stack. but the object on the heap is exixts . So just return the address of the making pointer.

> When an object is returned at compile-time it can be stored an anonymous varaible of same returning dataType and then assign it the varible on which the functions call this process is called the `RETURN_VALUE_OPTIMIZATION(RVO)`. And you when you run the program its destructor will be showed in the screen .
