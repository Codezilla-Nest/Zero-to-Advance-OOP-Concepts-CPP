# Core Concepts

A langugae which containes these four core segments is referrred as **_Object-Oriented-Programming_** language.

- ## Classes and object :
  Classes have no exixtence in the memeory, it's only a blueprint.When we make an object of that class, then it should having the same memeory.Class is a user defined-data-Type, called as **_ABSTRACT_DATA_TYPE_**.
- ## Data Hiding and Encapsulation:
  Data hided from every another object is called data hiding. All the members of a class including data members and member functions are closed in a class like a capsule is referred to as Encapsulation. This feature opens a new term named as `Abstraction` which means that all the inner details are completetly ignored and we focus only on the working of the software.
- ## Inheritance:
  **_Do not reinvent the wheel_**.In programming the term used as : **Do not repeat the codeâ›”**.Inheritance has the code reuse-ability.Some features are inherited from the base class and given to the derived class.If any language does not support the inheritance then its not calle the Object oriented programming language its called the **\*Object-Based-Language**.
- ## Polymorphism
  Define as : Single interface having multiple functionalities.(same name different behaviour).
  It has two types :
  - Static
    Function overloading is done in static polymorphism.It has be achieved on the compile time also called the **_compile_time_binding_**.
  - Dynamic
    Function overriding is done in the dynamic polymorphism.It has be achieved on the run time also called the **_Run_Time_binding_**.
